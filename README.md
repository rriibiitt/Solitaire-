Team Name: Solitaire

This is a digital, Klondike-style solitaire game. To play, you simply click the card you want to move, then drag it where you want to move it to. If it is a valid move, the card will go to the place you clicked. The point of the game is to sort all cards into foundation piles of the same suite, in ascending order starting with the Aces. There are seven tableau piles that you can use to hold your cards until you are ready to move them into the foundation piles. To place a card into these piles, you must place it on top of a card of a value one greater than the card you intend to move, and the opposite color. For example, a six of hearts can be placed on either a seven of spades or a seven of clubs. To win, simply move all the cards into the foundation piles.

The purpose of this project is to provide a mentally stimulating way to relax for stressed out students.
